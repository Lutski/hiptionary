        A gen y or later man whom is trying desperately to be masculine by looking the part instead of being the part, eg, dressing up like a lumberjack. This is done primarily to capture lost or missing masculinity due to being emasculated by things such as his childhood environment (effeminate father, overbearing soccer mom mother, play dates, trophies for losing.... etc.), feminism, modern urban culture, and 'Sex In The City' reruns. He tries to achieve this masculinity by mimicking real men, and in this particular case a lumberjack due to their connection to blue collar work and an outdoor workplace. To distinguish between the two a number of markers serve as convincing evidence to determine between the real man and the poser. 1. Look at their hands. A lumberjack will have leather for skin, many scars, and sometimes (more often than not) crooked fingers from broken bones not properly set and treated with twigs and duct tape.... a lumbersexual will have smooth, soft hands that smell like lotion. 2. Look at their face. The lumberjack will have weathered skin and probably some scars attributed to flying debris, cable burrs, falling branches, and a number of scenarios involving axes and chain saws. 3. Offer to buy them coffee. The lumberjack will have straight up coffee, maybe with a little cream. The lumbersexual will have some sort of latte or some other fancy schmancy french shit",
